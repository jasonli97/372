        <p class = "ptext">Hi! I'm Tracy,an outdoor enthusiast with a deep love for nature and a 
            simple life shared with my three dogs: Molly, Nori, and Mocha. My happiest moments 
            are those spent under the open sky, whether it's hiking through the untouched wilderness, 
            camping under the stars, or simply enjoying the tranquility of a sunrise with my furry 
            companions by my side. Join me as I embrace the beauty of nature, 
            the thrill of exploration, and the simple joys of life with Molly, Nori, and Mocha.
             Together, we're on a quest to make the most of every day, one adventure at a time.
